As I sit down to finally type these words, I think back to all the memories we've made together, like pictures painted on a canvas or photos taken, moments that capture my love for you. From the very first moment we shared ourselves in the company of the stars, it was the first time I knew we had something special.

Do you remember, when we came across the hillside in front of Brock, where the world seemed to slow down just for us? The sun gently kissed our skin as we laid my picnic blanket, creating our own little haven through the chaos of life. Right there, surrounded by the beauty of nature and the warmth of your smile, I realized how truly blessed I am to have you in my life.

Eliana, your name is more than just a word to me; it's a promise of endless adventure, support, maybe a little attitude, but also boundless love. With each passing day, I love you more, that's how I know I love you more. You are the sun that hits my face every sabbath morning, and the hope that fills my days with joy and laughter.

I can't help but stare into your eyes, because that's when I see a future filled with endless possibilities, and I am filled with gratitude for the opportunity to share that future with you. I know that no challenge is too great, and no dream is out of reach.

MI amor, I promise to cherish you, to stand by you through the highs and lows of life, and to love you with every fiber of my being. Thank you for being my partner, my confidante, and my best friend. I am endlessly grateful for the gift of you, and I cannot wait to continue our journey together, hand in hand, forevermore.

Con todo el amor del mundo.

Solo Tuyo Erisito

            <h3>La que amo</h3>
            <p class="poem">La que amo,

                La que amo, siempre estará conmigo
                Memories flood, and stars that shine.
                El cielo me grita, pero la persigo
                The moments that were a sign

                Por la noche yo oro
                Long nights, Never thought twice
                Que dios no nos deja solos
                Of the love that I felt inside

                Eliana, nena, amor
                Promising a vow, not now but later
                Nombre de gran clamor
                Together love will grow greater

                En tus ojos brilla el cielo
                In your eyes, I see our future told.
                Sinfonía de belleza le da celo
                A life united we get to mold

                Con todo lo que me hace hecho,
                To cherish, to love, until the end.
                Lo siento por tomar tanto tiempo.
                For you my love, it's always a full send.

                Con todo el amor del mundo,

                Solo Tuyo Erisito
